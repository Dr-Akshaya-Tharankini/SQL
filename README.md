# Healthcare Data Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates **data analysis on a healthcare dataset** using **SQL**. The purpose is to gain analytical insights into patient demographics, hospital utilization, insurance preferences, disease prevalence, medication patterns, and billing trends. While the dataset is synthetic and not based on real patient data, the queries and logic mirror real-world healthcare reporting and analysis scenarios.
